# Low Rank Matrix Approximation for 3D Geometry Filtering, IEEE TVCG 2020

# How to use:

(1)	install Matlab (tested successfully on Matlab 2021a, 2015 etc)

(2)	for point cloud data, run “Implementation_lowrankpaper_pointcloud.m” in the folder of low-rank-pointcloud

(3)	for mesh data, run “Implementation_lowrankpaper_mesh.m” in the folder of low-rank_mesh.
Note: the released code is only the basic implementation, which might have slight difference in filtering/denosing results. The code is for research purpose only.
